Problem Statement:

In urban areas, public and household waste management is a growing challenge. One of
the key issues is hygiene and convenience while disposing of waste. Traditional dustbins
require manual contact to open their lids, increasing the risk of germ transmission and
contamination. There is a need for an automated, touchless system to make waste disposal
more hygienic, convenient, and efficient.

Scope of the Solution:

The proposed solution involves developing an Automated Dustbin System that uses
an Arduino UNO microcontroller to control a motion sensor and a servo motor. The
system will detect the presence of an object (e.g., a hand or trash) near the dustbin and
automatically open the lid, reducing manual contact. The scope includes:

• Improving Hygiene: Minimizing contact with the dustbin lid to prevent the
spread of germs and bacteria.

• User Convenience: Providing a hands-free waste disposal experience.

• Environmentally Friendly: Encouraging proper waste disposal practices.

• Scalability: The system can be further upgraded with additional features like
waste level detection and solar-powered operation.

Required Components

Hardware Components:

• Arduino UNO: To control and process sensor input and motor output.

• Ultrasonic Sensor (e.g., HC-SR04): To detect the presence of objects near the
dustbin.

• Servo Motor: To open and close the lid based on sensor input.

• Dustbin with Hinged Lid: To serve as the base for the automated system.

• Breadboard and Jumper Wires: For circuit connections.

• Resistors (if needed): To control current in the circuit.

• Power Supply (e.g., 9V battery or USB cable): To power the Arduino board.

Software Requirements:

• Tinkercad: A web-based platform used to design and simulate the circuit and
Arduino code. Within Tinkercad, the following components are used:
Arduino UNO (virtual model),Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04, virtual model),Servo Motor (virtual model),Virtual breadboard for connections

• Arduino IDE: To write, compile, and upload the code to the Arduino UNO for
real-world implementation.

• Visual Studio Code (with PlatformIO extension): An alternative IDE for
writing and managing Arduino projects.
